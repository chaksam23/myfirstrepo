                    <p style="text-align: justify;">No institution comes from the blue. And every remarkable incident in the history of mankind has
                        its own prelude. On the auspicious day of 3rd February in the year of 1957, the residents of the
                        locality of nabagram happen to witness such an epoch making event to Cater the burgeoning
                        demands for dissemination of Higher Education among the local populace- Nabagram Hiralal Paul
                        College was founded. But many a real hero of social reformation of and remain unsung. Quite
                        appropriately goes the saying in the locality of Nabagram that Nabagram could not dream of a
                        college without Hiralal Paul. Duda indefatigable agility, philanthropic and altruistic
                        endeavours of late Hiralal Paul the college was established. Dr BC Roy the then chief Minister
                        government of West Bengal laid the foundation stone. Hiralal Babu had a dream to realise," I
                        have just been able to plant a little sapling for the dissemination of Higher Education and it
                        is impregnated with the potentiality of growing into a big tree with full Blossom if nourished
                        with care in the years to come."
